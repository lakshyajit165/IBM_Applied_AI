%%bash
ibmcloud target --cf-api https://api.eu-gb.cf.cloud.ibm.com -r eu-gb -o lakshmeekant@gmail.com
ibmcloud account space-create computer-vision-app
ibmcloud cf install


ibmcloud cf 



%%bash
ibmcloud target --cf-api https://api.REGION.cf.cloud.ibm.com -r REGION -o EMAIL

Then,

• Update "python-3.6.8 to "python-3.6.9" in runtime.txt

• Add line "werkzeug==0.16.1" in requirements.txt

Also, change the name of the app from "computer-vision-app" to anything else that you are comfortable with, e.g-"Shehryar-computer-vision-app", and update the same name in manifest.yml as instructed as mentioned in the Jupyter Notebook of the project.

Let me know if you still face the same.

Thanks, Srishti
